# React Portfolio [View Live &#10555;](https://sofia-andersson.netlify.app/)

This is my portfolio built with React, using Styled Components to style it. A practise in structuring code and components.

## The problem

- The app has Styled Components built with React.
-  The components are reusable.
- The portfolio is following a design guideline. Images, colors and animations are added by me. 
- The Featured Projects section fetch data in JSON format from a own JSON file.

I created and imported components one by one, starting with mobile format and then added media-queries. Found a great tool for building and viewing different formats: Responsively App which I think has been very helpful for creating media queries.

When I choose to spend more time on this project I will:
- Add more of my projects to the portfolio
- Create and add more components such as My thoughts and Tech.
- Create a global file in which I place reusable elements and styling such as buttons, wrappers, headings etc.
- Test the page for people using screen readers and keyboard navigation.
- Use props in more places.
- Validate my code in a validation tool

## TECH used:
- React
- Styled Components
- Fetch
- CSS
